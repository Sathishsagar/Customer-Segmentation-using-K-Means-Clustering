Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Description:
This project performs Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering based on the following customer attributes:

CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)
The segmentation groups customers into clusters to identify patterns and behaviors, helping businesses better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions.

Features:

Data Analysis and Clustering:
Utilized K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their annual income and spending behavior.
Interactive GUI:
The output of the customer segmentation is displayed on a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), enabling easy visualization of customer groups.
Visualization:
Segments are displayed graphically for clear insights, such as scatter plots with cluster coloring.
Tech Stack:

Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas (Data Preprocessing)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (K-Means Clustering)
Tkinter / PyQt (GUI Implementation)
Highlights:

Grouped customers into distinct segments based on spending habits and income.
Created an intuitive GUI to visualize the clusters.
Provides actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship strategies.
